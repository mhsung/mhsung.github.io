# CS492(D): Geometry Modeling and Processing

## Description
3D content creation is a crucial part of many industries such as graphics, AR/VR, CAD/CAM, and digital fabrication, which tasks typically include designing and creating virtual objects/scenes or reconstructing a real environment. Processing scanned 3D data is also an important problem in many applications as 3D scanning technology is being widely applied, for example, in autonomous driving, robot navigation, and 3D object replication.

In this course, we discuss fundamental mathematical methods for geometric 3D modeling and geometric data processing, which can be used (not only in graphics-related fields but) in many other areas in science and engineering. Topics to be covered include the followings:

- Homogeneous coordinates and geometric transformations
- Quaternions and their use in modeling 3-d rotations and rigid motions
- Parametric and implicit representations for curves
- Algebraic classification of the parametric polynomial curves of low degree
- Polar forms and the de Casteljau's subdivision algorithm
- The BÃ©zier representation and the Bernstein basis
- Splines and continuity constraints
- B-Splines and the de Boor's algorithm
- Rational curves
- Parametric polynomial surfaces and NURBS
- Subdivision curves and surfaces
- Triangle meshes for surface representation and reconstruction
- The quad-edge data structure for manifold subdivision
- Volumetric representations and conversion algorithms
- Surface reconstruction from scattered points
- Scan alignment and shape matching
- Mesh simplification and fairing
- Mesh parametrization and other geometry processing algorithms
