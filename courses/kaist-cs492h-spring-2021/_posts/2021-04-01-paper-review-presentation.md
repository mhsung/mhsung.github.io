### Presentation
- We'll have *two* presentations each day, and each presentation will be *20 mins* long.
- The presenter will ask at least *three* questions during the presentation.<br>
You'll need to answer them in the Slack *#lectures* channel (as we've done in previous lectures).
- Each presentation will be followed by a *7-10 min* group discussion.
- After the group discussion, the presenter will have *5 mins* to answer questions.
<br />

### Group Discussion
- One of the group members will be selected as a *group moderator.*<br>
(Our TA will post the list of group moderators in the Slack *#paper-reviews* channel.)
- The *group moderator* is responsible for
    - leading the discussion,
    - writing *questions* in the Slack *#paper-reviews* channel, and
    - build a consensus of the presentation *evaluation*.
- After the group discussion, our TA will send a *direct message* to the *group moderators* in Slack and ask about the *peer evaluation result*.
<br />


### Peer Evaluaton
Please evaluate the presentation based on the following criteria:

- The presenter clearly delivered the problem statement and the key ideas.
- The presentation was well organized and prepared.
- The presenter was knowledgeable about the topic and any related issues.
- The presenter maintained my interest during the entire presentation.
- The visual aids were effective.

*DO NOT* evaluate based on
- speech skills (it’s not a speech course),
- technical issues of zoom, and
- whether the presenter used the author’s other’s slides.<br>
(Feel free to use slides on the Internet with reference.)

In each group, please write a *short comment* to the presenter and *choose one of the following* (you can choose *in-betweens*):
- <h>Probably the best presentation!</h>
- <h>It was clear and well organized.</h>
- <h>Good, but I couldn’t follow some.</h>
- <h>It could be better!</h>
- <h>Poor.</h>

*DO NOT write the evaluation result in the public channel.*<br>
Our TA will send a direct message to the *group moderators* in Slack and ask about the peer evaluation result.
<br />
