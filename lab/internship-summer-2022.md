We’re looking for undergraduate interns who are interested in building <em>cutting-edge machine learning technologies for 3D geometric data</em>. ML for 3D is a rising topic in multiple research communities including computer vision, computer graphics, and robotics — for example, see the paper statistics of CVPR 2020 and 2021 <em><a href="https://github.com/hoya012/CVPR-2021-Paper-Statistics/blob/main/2021_cvpr/top_keywords_2020%2B2021.png" target="_blank">here</a></em>. `3D’ is ranked in the top 3 in a row. During the internship, you will work on your own research project with a topic in this field and learn and discuss with us 1) how to <em>find</em> a good research topic, 2) how to <em>develop</em> your research idea, 3) how to <em>implement and prototype</em> the idea, and finally (and possibly), 4) how to <em>demonstrate</em> the research outcomes in a paper.


Research topics include, but are not limited to:
- Neural rendering
- Generative models for 3D data
    - Score-based diffusion models for 3D data
    - Generative models for textures
- Language-to-3D
- Discovering structure in 3D
- Learning generalizable 3D structure
- 3D deformation
- Unsupervised 3D segmentation
- 3D shape representations for completion and denoising
- Learning with 3D graphs
- Learning for human poses
- Geometry of feature spaces

- <em><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/" target="_blank">My webpage</a></em>.


### Requirements
- We're looking for students who have experience in developing any <em>deep learning</em> techniques (either with PyTorch or TensorFlow).
- Candidates who have taken or audited the <em><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/kaist-cs492a-spring-2022/" target="_blank">CS492(A): Machine Learning for 3D Data</a></em> course will be preferred (but not required). All potential candidates will be asked to finish following the course materials before starting the internship.
- Interns will be required to be <em>physically present</em> in our lab during the internship.<br>
  Location: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Cv7wKzf4jhA1ezuh7" target="_blank">KAIST, N1 Bldg, Rm 622, 291 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, Korea 34141. </a>
- Candidates who can extend the internship after the summer will be preferred. (Remote work can be considered for the extension.)


### Conditions
- Interns will be expected to commit to the internship for <em>full-time at least 8 weeks</em> this summer. The starting and the end dates are flexible, but the desired start and end dates are:<br>
  **Start date: Jun 27 (Mon)**<br>
  **End date: Aug 26 (Fri)**<br>
  (including one week break during the internship)
- Interns will be <em>paid</em> and provided with a desk in our lab and computing resources (access to either KCloud or our own GPU servers).


### How to Apply
<em><h>Deadline</h>: May 20 (Friday), 23:59 KST.</em>

Please submit the following application form:

You'll need to prepare the followings:
- your <em>CV/resume</em> (including your previous experience in research, internship, or course projects, and your programming skills).
- a copy of your <em>transcript</em>, and
- a short description of why you're interested in this internship and what you expect to do in the internship.


### FAQ
- Q. Can non-KAIST students apply?<br>
A. Yes.

- Q. Can non-KAIST students stay in a KAIST dormitory during the internship?
A. Yes.

- Q. Can people who are not enrolled in any Korean institutions apply?<br>
A. Yes, but we will NOT be able to pay you for the internship in this case.
