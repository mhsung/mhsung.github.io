We’re looking for undergraduate interns who are interested in developing <em>cutting-edge machine learning techniques for 3D geometric data</em>. ML for 3D is a rising topic in multiple research communities including computer vision, computer graphics, and robotics — for example, see the paper statistics of CVPR 2019 and 2020 <em><a href="https://github.com/hoya012/CVPR-2020-Paper-Statistics/blob/master/2020_cvpr/top_keywords_2019%2B2020.jpg" target="_blank">here</a></em>. `3D’ is ranked in the top 3 in a row. During the internship, you will work on your own research project with a topic in this field and learn and discuss with us 1) how to <em>find</em> a good research topic, 2) how to <em>develop</em> your research idea, 3) how to <em>implement and prototype</em> the idea, and finally (and possibly), 4) how to <em>demonstrate</em> the research outcomes in a paper.


Research topics include, but are not limited to:
- 3D reconstruction
- 3D generative models
- 3D structural parsing
- Rigid / non-rigid shape alignment
- 3D transformer
- 3D from 2D / 3D from X
- Neural rendering
- Learning for generalizability to unseen 3D data
- Learning for shape deformation
- Learning from weak 3D supervision

- <em><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/" target="_blank">my personal webpage</a></em>, and
- <em><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/{{site.research_statement}}" target="_blank">my research statement</a></em>.


### Requirements
- We're looking for students who have experience in developing any <em>deep learning</em> techniques (either with PyTorch or TensorFlow).
- Students who are now taking or auditing the <em><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/courses/kaist-cs492-3dml-2021-spring/" target="_blank">CS492(H): Machine Learning for 3D Data</a></em> course will be preferred (but not required). All potential candidates will be asked to finish following the course materials before starting the internship so that they can have enough background to do research.
- Students who can extend the internship after the summer will be preferred.


### Conditions
- Interns will be expected to commit to the internship for <em>full-time at least 8 weeks</em> this summer. The starting and the end dates are flexible, but the desired starting date is mid June.
- Interns will be <em>paid</em> a reasonable salary and provided with a desk in the <em>N1</em> building and computing resources (access to either KCloud or our own GPU servers).
- Interns will also be expected to be <em>physically present</em> in the office during the internship, but if you need to work remotely, we can discuss the WFH option.


### How to Apply
<em><h>Deadline</h>: Apr 30 (Friday), 23:59 KST.</em>

Please send an email to <em><a href="mailto: {{site.email}}">{{site.email}}</a></em> with a subject starting with <em>[Internship]</em> and also the followings:
- your <em>CV/resume</em> (including your previous experience in research, internship, or course projects, and your programming skills).
- a copy of your <em>transcript</em>, and
- a description about why you're interested in this internship and what you expect to do in the internship.
