We’re looking for undergraduate interns who are interested in building <em>cutting-edge machine learning technologies for 3D geometric data</em>.
<!--
ML for 3D is a rising topic in multiple research communities including computer vision, computer graphics, and robotics — for example, see the paper statistics of CVPR 2021 and 2022 <em><a href="https://github.com/BIGBALLON/CVPR2022-Paper-Statistics/blob/master/output/keyworks-2122.png" target="_blank">here</a></em>. `3D’ is ranked in the top 5 in a row.
During the internship, you will work on your own research project with a topic in this field and learn and discuss with us 1) how to <em>find</em> a good research topic, 2) how to <em>develop</em> your research idea, 3) how to <em>implement and prototype</em> the idea, and finally (and possibly), 4) how to <em>demonstrate</em> the research outcomes in a paper.
-->
Research topics include, but are not limited to:
- 3D generative models
- Shape editing/deformation
- Texture generation
- Neural rendering
- Neural materials
- Language-to-3D
- Discovering structure in 3D
- Diffusion Models on Graphs

To find more information, visit the following:
- Explore our recent research on my <em><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/" target="_blank">my webpage</a></em>.
- Check out my tutorial talk <em><a href="https://kaistackr-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/mhsung_kaist_ac_kr/EVIKXKGuVzpOhYMD1BEiY2sBSt0XH0Ej9QW0Ua4I9ZWirg?e=ogMgCA" target="_blank">slides</a></em> covering NeRF, diffusion models, and 3D generation.
- Dive into my talk <em><a href="https://kaistackr-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/mhsung_kaist_ac_kr/EeHEwtyEHDlLuQt7C_NyKV8BqHYHMX_f023JQ-jKEflFNA?e=q7d3hL" target="_blank">slides</a></em> that focus on 3D shape generation and editing.
- Visit the <em><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/kaist-cs479-fall-2023/" target="_blank">CS479: Machine Learning for 3D Data</a></em> course webpage for additional resources.


### Requirements
- We're looking for students who have experience in developing any <em>deep learning</em> techniques (either with PyTorch or TensorFlow).
- Candidates who have taken or audited the <em><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/kaist-cs479-fall-2023/" target="_blank">CS479: Machine Learning for 3D Data</a></em> course will be preferred (but not required). All potential candidates will be asked to finish following the course materials before starting the internship.
- Interns will be required to be <em>physically present</em> in our lab during the internship.<br>
  Location: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Cv7wKzf4jhA1ezuh7" target="_blank">KAIST, N1 Bldg, Rm 622, 291 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, Korea 34141. </a>
- Candidates who can extend the internship after the winter will be preferred. (Remote work can be considered for the extension.)


### Conditions
- Interns will be expected to commit to the internship for <em>full-time at least 8 weeks</em> this winter. The starting and the end dates are flexible, but the desired start and end dates are:<br>
  **Start date: December 26 (Tue)**<br>
  **End date: February 23 (Fri)**<br>
- Interns will be <em>paid</em> and provided with a desk in our lab and computing resources (access to a GPU cluster).


### How to Apply
<em>Deadline</em>: <h>November 12 (Sun), 23:59 KST.</h><br>
<em>Application Form</em>: <h><a href="https://research.typeform.com/to/VhGdjeWP" target="_blank">Link</a></h><br>

You'll need to prepare the following files:
- a copy of your <em>transcript</em>, and
- your <em>CV/resume</em> (including your previous experience in research, internship, or course projects, and your programming skills. Not required but recommended).


### FAQ
- Q. Can non-KAIST students apply?<br>
A. Yes.

- Q. Can non-KAIST students stay in a KAIST dormitory during the internship?<br>
A. Yes.

- Q. Can people who are not enrolled in any Korean institutions apply?<br>
A. Yes, but we recommend applying for the internship via the <a href="http://winter.kaist.ac.kr/" target="_blank">KAIST International Winter School</a> program.
