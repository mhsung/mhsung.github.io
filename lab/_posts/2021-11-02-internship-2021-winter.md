We’re looking for undergraduate interns who are interested in developing <em>cutting-edge machine learning techniques for 3D geometric data</em>. ML for 3D is a rising topic in multiple research communities including computer vision, computer graphics, and robotics — for example, see the paper statistics of CVPR 2020 and 2021 <em><a href="https://github.com/hoya012/CVPR-2021-Paper-Statistics/blob/main/2021_cvpr/top_keywords_2020%2B2021.png" target="_blank">here</a></em>. `3D’ is ranked in the top 3 in a row. During the internship, you will work on your own research project with a topic in this field and learn and discuss with us 1) how to <em>find</em> a good research topic, 2) how to <em>develop</em> your research idea, 3) how to <em>implement and prototype</em> the idea, and finally (and possibly), 4) how to <em>demonstrate</em> the research outcomes in a paper.


Research topics include, but are not limited to:
- 3D reconstruction
- 3D generative models
- 3D structural parsing
- Rigid / non-rigid shape alignment
- 3D transformer
- 3D from 2D / 3D from X
- Neural rendering
- Learning for generalizability to unseen 3D data
- Learning for shape deformation
- Learning from weak 3D supervision

### Requirements
- We're looking for students who have experience in developing any <em>deep learning</em> techniques (either with PyTorch or TensorFlow).
- Students who have taken/audited or are now taking/auditing the courses in the reference above will be preferred (but not required).
- Students who can extend the internship after the winter will be preferred.


### Conditions
- Interns will be expected to commit to the internship for <em>full-time at least 8 weeks</em> this winter. The desired starting date is either the last week of December or the first week of January.
- Interns will be <em>paid</em> a reasonable salary and provided with a desk in the <em>N1</em> building and computing resources (access to either KCloud or our own GPU servers).
- Interns will also be expected to be <em>physically present</em> in the office during the internship, but if you need to work remotely, we can discuss the WFH option.


### How to Apply
<em><h>Deadline</h>: Nov 17 (Wednesday), 23:59 KST.</em>

Please send an email to <em><a href="mailto: {{site.email}}">{{site.email}}</a></em> with a subject starting with <em>[Internship]</em> and also the followings:
- your <em>CV/resume</em> (including your previous experience in research, internship, or course projects, and your programming skills).
- a copy of your <em>transcript</em>, and
- a description about why you're interested in this internship and what you expect to do in the internship.
